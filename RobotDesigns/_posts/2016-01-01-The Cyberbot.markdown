This new NXT robot design is compact and very sturdy - ideal for classroom usage. It has been designed for use in our lessons and also works well on our Training Mats. We name it Cyberbot because of its distinctive handle which makes it look like a Cyberman from Dr. Who. The robot features a shielded color sensor as well as modular/easy to add sensors and a third motor.
