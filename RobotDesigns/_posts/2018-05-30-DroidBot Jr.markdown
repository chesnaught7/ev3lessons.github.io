Droid Bot JR is a robot build using only parts from 31313 LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Set. This build is slightly smaller than Droid Bot 2.0, but still has many similar features. An optional handle allows for easy carrying in classrooms. It has been designed to allow the builder to easily replace the infrared sensor with the ultrasonic, use a rechargeable battery, and add a gyro sensor if needed.
