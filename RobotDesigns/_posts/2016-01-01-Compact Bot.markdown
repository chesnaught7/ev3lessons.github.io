Compact Bot is a basic robot build using the 45544 LEGO® MINDSTORMS® Education EV3 Core Set + 1 motor. It has a back bumper for aligning (straightening the robot by bumping into walls and objects) and a third large motor for attachments. There are a few variations on the build available on this site.
