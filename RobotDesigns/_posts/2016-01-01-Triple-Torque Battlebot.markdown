This LEGO MINDTORMS EV3 Sumo Bot uses three EV3 Large Motors, two of which have "triple torque" due to gearing. In the false-colored picture, the pink 12-tooth gear that is directly connected to the EV3 Large Motor touches the turquoise 36-tooth gear. This "gearing down" increases its torque three times, for increased pushing power. The center motor operates the yellow "flipper" arms for upending opposing robots in a Lego Sumo or Battlebot competition. Parts from the EV3 45544 Education Set are supplemented by the third motor and EV3 Color Sensor (for detecting the edge of a Lego Sumo arena). You can use your spare parts to make the flipper larger; with it in the "up" position, it measures ~7"x7" (~22x22 studs). The EV3 Ultrasonic Sensor detects the opposing robot, or it can be replaced by a Mindsensors "Sumo Eyes" sensor for SuGObot competitions.
