I'm Possible Too is an autonomous biped walker using just one medium motor. It is built using parts from the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition and EV3 Expansion Set and some parts from other technic sets such as the turntable type 2. When you are done building this design, visit Stu's website to try all his other walkers.
