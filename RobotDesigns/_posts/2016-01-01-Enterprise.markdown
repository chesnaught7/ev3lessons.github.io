EV3 Enterprise is a robot built using parts from the 31313 LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Set. This robot has a base that only uses 82 pieces. Sensor and motor modules easily snap on to the base robot as the student needs. (The robot has optional instructions for adding a gyro and second color sensor. The infrared can also replaced with the ultrasonic if needed.)
